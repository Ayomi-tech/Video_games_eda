The video games analytics project deconstructs insights from global video game data and answers queries such as:

According to the statistics we have, where do video game sales tend to be the highest? 

Which year had the highest sales? 

Which product generates the most revenue?

Who is the most important publisher?

Which genre has the most games?

Which genre has the most global revenue?

Analysis of video games, in conclusion. Shows that NA_Sales(North America) had the largest revenue, and also has the most worldwide sales in 2018.

I would advise any investor interested in investing in video games in North America to focus on action games and role-playing games in Japan, and as for Europe should invest in action games.
